Branch for Role and Permission

Use middleware for roles ( in this case I only used 2 roles : Admin and User)

Steps :
1. Every role has their own folders, controllers, views, etc.
2. Learn how to make Routing in web.php for each role
3. Learn how to make middleware for each role ( don't forget about relationships in Models, Ex : User has ONE role, Role has many Users )

If there are any errors, check the top lines of your coding ( your includes, namespaces,

Ex :
use App\Http\Controllers bla-bla-bla )
